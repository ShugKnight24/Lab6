# Lab 6

*Update:* Changes made on 8/17/2017. I was refactoring old code while streaming on Twitch. Changed scripts.js to script.js, added `'use strict';` to script file, caught an embarrassing error where I used the wrong formula for conversions of both temperatures, changed the output answers in the comments.
